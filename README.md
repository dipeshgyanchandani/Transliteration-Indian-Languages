# Transliteration and Image Captioning Models

This repository contains the implementation of two key components aimed at solving the problem of machine transliteration and image captioning. The project focuses on transliteration between English and Hindi using a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model and image captioning to detect and extract text from signboard images.

# Key Components

## 1. Image Captioning Model
This model detects and extracts text from images of signboards. It uses an object detection framework, specifically YOLO, to identify text regions in images. The text is then passed to the image captioning model, which generates a readable string.

Object Detection (YOLO): Detects the text regions in the image.
Image Captioning Model: Converts the detected text regions into a readable format (string).
Technology Stack:
YOLO for text detection
PyTorch for training and deploying the model
Python for data preprocessing and model development
2. Transliteration Model
The Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) Encoder-Decoder model with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture is used to perform transliteration between English and Hindi. The model is designed to handle long-range dependencies and improve the accuracy of transliteration using an attention mechanism.

## Seq2Seq Model: Encodes the input sequence and decodes it to the desired output sequence.
Attention Mechanism: Enhances the modelâ€™s performance by focusing on specific parts of the input sequence when generating the output.
Technology Stack:
PyTorch for building the model
LSTM for sequence processing
Python for data processing, training, and model evaluation
System Design

## The system design of the transliteration and image captioning pipeline is as follows:

# Flow Overview:
Image Upload: An image containing text (e.g., signboard image) is provided as input.
Text Detection:
The image is passed through the object detection model (YOLO) to detect text regions.
Text Extraction:
The detected regions of text are extracted and passed to the image captioning model for generating the readable text.
Transliteration:
The extracted text is sent to the transliteration model (Seq2Seq LSTM) for converting it from English to Hindi (or vice versa).
Output: The transliterated text is returned.

Installation

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
PyTorch
TensorFlow (if you plan to use pre-trained models)
YOLO (for object detection, if you're using it)
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Signboard-Translation.git
cd Signboard-Translation
Environment Setup
Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you're using YOLO for object detection, make sure to download the necessary weights and configurations for YOLO (e.g., from YOLO website).
Run the Model
For image captioning:
Run the model on the input image by calling the image captioning function from the respective script.
For transliteration:
Load your transliteration model (e.g., Eng2Hindi_DL_Transliteration.ipynb).
Pass the extracted text from the image to the model for transliteration.
